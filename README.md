Tip Calculator

Day 2 Project from 100DaysOfCode (Python) with Angela Yu.

The tip calculator will calculate the tip and add it to the bill. 

It will also split the total bill if required. 

Just enter the bill amount, the percentage of the tip (without the %), and the amount of people paying.

The calculator will tell you how much each person needs to pay :)

Enjoy!!!
